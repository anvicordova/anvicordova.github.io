This weekend tiny project was about creating some CSS only image.
I ended up with an Egg-Panda thing that I called Meh!

Although a bit simple, it helped me to practice a bit, and learned a few things
in the process. Definitely I need to learn more about CSS ... I have the feeling
that I could have used simpler styles in some cases.

Anyways, not bad for a first, I think!  

Check it out below or in [Github](https://github.com/anvicordova/meh-egg-panda).
